## Description

This project aims to analyze the data of a laboratory that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. The data is the result of an animal study made to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other seven treatment regimens for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated. During 45 days of the treatment, tumor development was observed and measured.

To start the analysis, it was necessary to identify the report's duplicates lines and remove them from the data to proceed and generate summary statistics that included a table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen. 

The report includes the number of mice treated by each regimen and gender. Since these variables could bring insight into the result, they were plotted using bar charts and pie charts. 

Since the study's purpose was to focus on Capomulin performance, the information was narrow from seven treatments to four. The quartiles and outliers were identified in the four groups and plotted to understand these levels better.

A correlation coefficient and linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regime was calculated, reflecting the relationship between these two variables to finalize the analysis and proceed with the conclusions (included at the top of the report).
